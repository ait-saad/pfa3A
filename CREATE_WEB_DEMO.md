# Create Simple Web Demo for Sleep Tracker

I can quickly create a web-based demo that:

## Features:
- ✅ Simple HTML/CSS/JavaScript interface
- ✅ Works directly in browser (no complex setup)
- ✅ Connects to your existing backend API
- ✅ Simulates accelerometer data
- ✅ Shows real-time tracking
- ✅ Displays sleep analysis with charts
- ✅ Shows recommendations
- ✅ Perfect for presentations

## Would include:
1. **Home Page** - Start tracking button
2. **Tracking Page** - Timer, simulated data collection
3. **Results Page** - Sleep score, charts, recommendations
4. **History Page** - Previous sessions

## Time to create: ~10 minutes

## Would you like me to create this web demo?
